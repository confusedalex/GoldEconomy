Good straight forward plugin. It lets you make your economy based of players dedication to the server, since they must go mine, and not them just doing automated farms and sell items to shop. It also comes with an anti gold drop.
 Also, the author of the plugin is very nice. Helped me about some translation stuff.

I love the simplicity of this plugin for our small survival server. It literally just ties the economy to the in-game gold, with one unit of currency equal to a gold nugget. It works great!
